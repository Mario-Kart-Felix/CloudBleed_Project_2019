Under Washington law, companies are required to notify the Attorney General’s office if the incident affects more than 500 of the state’s residents. In this instance Boeing claims the information of 7,288 Washington residents may have been impacted.According to the letter, the breach occurred on Nov. 21, 2016 after a Boeing employee encountered a formatting issue and emailed a spreadsheet to his spouse who didn’t work at the company. The file contained sensitive, personally identifiable information of 36,000 of the aircraft manufacturer’s employees. The file included the names, places of birth, BEMSID, or employee ID numbers, and accounting department codes. The spreadsheet also included Social security numbers and dates of birth, albeit in “hidden columns,” according to Olson.Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft’s Excel, usually allows authors to make select information hidden, usually to prevent that data from being seen, changed, or deleted.According to Olson’s letter, the breach was discovered earlier this year, on Jan. 9, but the company didn’t begin to inform employees until a month later, Feb. 8.In the letter to Ferguson, Boeing claims it destroyed copies of the spreadsheet and carried out a “forensic examination” of both the Boeing employee’s computer and his spouse’s to ensure it was deleted.""More information: https://threatpost.com/boeing-notifies-36000-employees-following-breach/...","Media","","2017","47.606210","-122.332071"

Medical records of patients continued to be accessed until December 2016.The types of information accessed included patients’ names, medical record IDs, and birth dates. According to a press release from VUMC, one individual was also able to view some patients’ Social Security numbers. While patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, VUMC does not believe that any information has been copied or misused.

The database, about 52 gigabytes in size, contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of companies, representing a large portion of the US corporate population. 	 	 	 	 	Dun & Bradstreet, a business services giant, confirmed that it owns the database, which it acquired as part  	of a 2015 deal to buy NetProspex for $125 million.The purchased database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers. 	 	 	 	 	Other information includes more generic corporate and publicly sourced data, such as believed office location, the number of employees in the business unit, and other descriptions of the kind of industry the company falls into, such as advertising, legal,  media and broadcasting, and telecoms. 	 	 	 	 	This entire database is used for marketers who want to directly target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers. 	 	 	 	 	The data can be bought either in bulk, or by type of record by companies, but it's not known exactly how much the going rate is for a full data set of this size. We understand from  	a 2015 brochure that the cost of accessing a half-million records can cost some firms up to $200,000. 	 	 	 	 	Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification site  	Have I Been Pwned, obtained the database and analyzed the records. 	 	 	 	 	In  	a blog post Tuesday, Hunt said the breakdown was entirely US-focused, with California as the most represented demographic with over four million records, then New York with 2.7 million records and Texas with 2.6 million records. 	 	 	 	 	Hunt's analysis of the records showed that the leading organization by records is the Dept. of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, followed closely by the US Postal Service with 88,153 employee records. 	 	 	 	 	The US Army, Air Force, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records. 	 	 	 	 	AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM, and Xerox were among the most named companies in the database, with tens of thousands of employee records each. 	 	 	 	 	""Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,"" said Hunt in an email on Tuesday. ""It also serves as a reminder that we've lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don't have any control over it."" 	 	 	 	 	Hunt ran the exposed database through  	Have I Been Pwned's database of breached records, which showed 14 percent of email addresses already existed in his database.

But in an update late Monday, DocuSign confirmed that this malicious third party was able to send the messages to customers and users because it had broken in and stolen DocuSign’s list of customers and users.“As part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,” DocuSign wrote in an alert posted to its site. “A complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed. No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign’s eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign’s core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure.”The company is asking people to forward any suspicious emails related to DocuSign to spam@docusign.com, and then to delete the missives. “They may appear suspicious because you don’t recognize the sender, weren’t expecting a document to sign, contain misspellings (like “docusgn.com” without an ‘i’ or @docus.com), contain an attachment, or direct you to a link that starts with anything other than https://www.docusign.com or https://www.docusign.net,” reads the advisory.If you have reason to expect a DocuSign document via email, don’t respond to an email that looks like it’s from DocuSign by clicking a link in the message. When in doubt, access your documents directly by visiting docusign.com, and entering the unique security code included at the bottom of every legitimate DocuSign email. DocuSign says it will never ask recipients to open a PDF, Office document or ZIP file in an email.DocuSign was already a perennial target for phishers and malware writers, but this incident is likely to intensify attacks against its users and customers. DocuSign says it has more than 100 million users, and it seems all but certain that the criminals who stole the company’s customer email list are going to be putting it to nefarious use for some time to come.""","Krebs On Security","https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/breach-at-docusign-led-to-targeted-email-malware-campaign/","2017","37.774930","-122.419416"

"May 19, 2017","Vine","Stamford","Connecticut","DISC","BSO","0","""Twitter is alerting Vine users of a bug that exposed their email addresses and, in some cases, phone numbers to third parties.

"May 17, 2017","MolinaHealthcare.com","Long Beach","California","DISC","MED","0","""Earlier this month, KrebsOnSecurity featured a story about a basic security flaw in the Web site of medical diagnostics firm True Health Group that let anyone who was logged in to the site view all other patient records. In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn’t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we’ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he’d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient’s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem. Molina also said it was trying to figure out how such a mistake was made, and if there was any evidence to suggest the Web site bug had been widely abused.“The previously identified security issue has been remediated,” the company said. “Because protecting our members’ information is of utmost importance to Molina and out of an abundance of caution, we are taking our ePortal temporarily offline to perform additional testing of our system security. Molina has also engaged Mandiant to assist the company in continuing to strengthen our system security.”","Krebs On Security","https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/molinahealthcare-com-exposed-patient-records/","2017","33.770050","-118.193740"

He said he found the treasure of information at the 77 Flea Market in Brownsville.“I knew exactly what it was… I knew exactly what I had from the moment I saw it,” he said. “I saw this and I thought, you know, ‘This is a major security flaw.’”The man said he knew the server was still accessible, because all six of its hard drives were still installed. However, he didn’t know at that point what was in it or how easy it would be to break into it.CHANNEL 5 NEWS Chief Engineer Michael Leal evaluated how to get into the 15-year-old server. He loaded a small version of Windows allowing him to see the file system without inputting a password.“Right now, I can see everything on this computer.

A spokesman for Kadri’s office, who declined to be identified, said the theft might affect patients in at least 17 states and seven countries outside the United States.“Despite having only recently being discovered, the breach, which affects thousands of patients, started shortly after the ... staffer was hired in September of 2016,” the statement read.A Palmdale residence belonging to Kadri was also burglarized May 5, according to a statement issued Thursday by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Patient files, medical supplies and electronic devices were stolen, authorities said. Kadri’s spokesman described the residence as an “administrative office” the surgeon uses when performing procedures in a Palmdale office.“Nobody knows it’s there except for us. It’s our registered address for all business documents,” the spokesman said.Though Kadri said in the statement that he believes the break-in was carried out by the same employee, the Sheriff’s Department said there were no witnesses. Investigators want to question the ex-employee, who has not yet been detained, according to the department statement.Calls to the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station on Friday seeking additional comment were not immediately returned.Kadri’s office also learned recently that an Instagram account was created to host what are believed to be illegal recordings of patients during surgery. The account, which contains videos of procedures and pictures of patients, published its earliest post in January.“These patients did not approve this,” the spokesman said. “We did not approve this.”The employee was hired as a driver for Kadri in September 2016, and over time she began to take on additional duties.

It lets startups unfamiliar with filling out SEC forms get comfortable with the process without publicly blasting out market-moving announcements.Now an initiative that was grounded in good intentions is causing the SEC headaches. The agency disclosed Wednesday that not only had cybercriminals breached Edgar, but they may have stolen corporate secrets that they profited from. The SEC blamed the 2016 intrusion -- which it was slow to reveal -- on a software vulnerability in its test system.Edgar houses millions of filings on disclosures ranging from corporate earnings to statements on mergers and acquisitions. Infiltrating it to review announcements before they are released publicly would serve as a virtual treasure trove for a hacker seeking to make easy money. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the agency’s review of the breach is ongoing and that it’s “coordinating with the appropriate authorities.”","Media","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-21/sec-says-hack-of-edgar-may-have-led-to-illicit-trading-profits","2017","38.907192","-77.036871"

The employee needed the information contained on the working spreadsheet document to prepare the email distribution list. The employee failed to remove the spreadsheet attachment before the email was sent. The department has policies, procedures and training in place to prevent inadvertent disclosures, but the mistake still occurred as a result of human error. The Academy’s technical security measures, however, prevented this email from being forwarded from the Academy email system to external addresses. We are not aware of the email being sent to anyone other than Academy employees. The Academy has no reason to believe that any information about you has been misused, but nonetheless wants to make sure you are aware of the issue. Those that are not impacted are not receiving this notification.What Information Was Involved?The attachment to the e-mail contained several spreadsheet tabs, one of which listed your first name, last name, and Social Security number.""","California Attorney General","https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-110849","2017","37.774930","-122.419416"

Gaining access illicitly was relatively easy.The data was highly sensitive, revealing personal details of Facebook users, such as the results of psychological tests. It was meant to be stored and shared anonymously, however such poor precautions were taken that deanonymising would not be hard.. . . .Facebook suspended myPersonality from its platform on 7 April saying the app may have violated its policies due to the language used in the app and on its website to describe how data is shared.More than 6 million people completed the tests on the myPersonality app and nearly half agreed to share data from their Facebook profiles with the project. All of this data was then scooped up and the names removed before it was put on a website to share with other researchers. The terms allow the myPersonality team to use and distribute the data “in an anonymous manner such that the information cannot be traced back to the individual user”.To get access to the full data set people had to register as a collaborator to the project. More than 280 people from nearly 150 institutions did this, including researchers at universities and at companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo.. . . .For the last four years, a working username and password has been available online that could be found from a single web search. Anyone who wanted access to the data set could have found the key to download it in less than a minute.The publicly available username and password were sitting on the code-sharing website GitHub. They had been passed from a university lecturer to some students for a course project on creating a tool for processing Facebook dataThe credentials gave access to the “Big Five” personality scores of 3.1 million users. These scores are used in psychology to assess people’s characteristics, such as conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism. The credentials also allowed access to 22 million status updates from over 150,000 users, alongside details such as age, gender and relationship status from 4.3 million people.. . . .Each user in the data set was given a unique ID, which tied together data such as their age, gender, location, status updates, results on the personality quiz and more. With that much information, de-anonymising the data can be done very easily. “You could re-identify someone online from a status update, gender and date,” says Dixon.","Media","https://www.newscientist.com/article/2168713-huge-new-facebook-data-leak-exposed-intimate-details-of-3m-users/","2018","37.774930","-122.419416"

"May 20, 2018","TeenSafe","Los Angeles","California","DISC","BSR","10,200","ZDNet's Zack Whittaker reports:At least one server used by an app for parents to monitor their teenagers' phone activity has leaked tens of thousands of accounts of both parents and children.The mobile app, TeenSafe, bills itself as a ""secure"" monitoring app for iOS and Android, which lets parents view their child's text messages and location, monitor who they're calling and when, access their web browsing history, and find out which apps they have installed.Although teen monitoring apps are controversial and privacy-invasive, the company says it doesn't require parents to obtain the consent of their children.But the Los Angeles, Calif.-based company left its servers, hosted on Amazon's cloud, unprotected and accessible by anyone without a password.. . . .The database stores the parent's email address associated with TeenSafe, as well as their corresponding child's Apple ID email address. It also includes the child's device name -- which is often just their name -- and their device's unique identifier. The data contains the plaintext passwords for the child's Apple ID. Because the app requires that two-factor authentication is turned off, a malicious actor viewing this data only needs to use the credentials to break into the child's account to access their personal content data.None of the records contained content data, such as photos or messages, or the locations of either parents or children.The data also contained error messages associated with a failed account action, such as if a parent looking up a child's real-time location didn't complete.Shortly before the server went offline, there were at least 10,200 records from the past three months containing customers data -- but some are duplicates.TeenSafe claims to have over a million parents using the service.   ","Media","https://www.zdnet.com/article/teen-phone-monitoring-app-leaks-thousands-of-users-data/","2018","34.052234","-118.243685"

The haul comprises close to 2 terabytes of data that appears to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults, as well as millions of businesses. While the precise number of individuals included in the data isn't clear—and the leak doesn't seem to contain credit card information or Social Security numbers—it does go into minute detail for each individual listed, including phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other highly personal characteristics for every name. The categories range from interests and habits to the number, age, and gender of the person's children.""It seems like this is a database with pretty much every US citizen in it,"" says Troia, who is the founder of his own New York-based security company, Night Lion Security. Troia notes that almost every person he's searched for in the database, he's found. And when WIRED asked him to find records for a list of 10 specific people in the database, he very quickly found six of them. ""I don’t know where the data is coming from, but it’s one of the most comprehensive collections I’ve ever seen,"" he says.""Aside from the sheer breadth of the Exactis leak, it may be even more remarkable for its depth: Each record contains entries that go far beyond contact information and public records to include more than 400 variables on a vast range of specific characteristics: whether the person smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats, and interests as varied as scuba diving and plus-size apparel. WIRED independently analyzed a sample of the data Troia shared and confirmed its authenticity, though in some cases the information is outdated or inaccurate."" ","Media","https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/","2018","29.584452","-81.207870"

However, it should be noted that the cardholder verification value that may have been accessed or acquired is not the same as the security code printed on the back of certain payment cards (e.g., Discover, MasterCard, and Visa) or printed on the front of other payment cards (e.g., American Express). Based on the nature of the breach, it was not possible to determine the identity or exact number of credit card numbers or names that were accessed or acquired during the breach time period.","Media","https://www.eatpdq.com/promos/news/2018/06/22/guestinfo","2018","27.950575","-82.457178"

The backend database powers the website of Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training -- known as ALERRT -- at Texas State University.The database dates back to April 2017 and was uploaded a year later to a web server, believed to be owned by the organization, with no password protection.. . . .The database contained thousands of personal data records, including law enforcement officer's work contact information, with many of the records listing personal email addresses, work addresses, and cell numbers.Officials from the FBI, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the US Border Patrol were listed in the database.In another table, some 65,000 officers who had taken an ALERRT course and provided feedback had their full name and zip code exposed.Another table listed detailed histories on instructors, including their skills and training, while another contained the names of more than 17,000 instructors.Another table contained 51,345 sets of geolocation coordinates of schools, courts, police departments, and government buildings, like city halls and administrative offices. The data also included places of interest, such as where people gather -- like universities and malls. The list also contained, in some cases, police officers' home addresses. We confirmed this using Google's Street View, which in several cases revealed marked police vehicles outside the residence.Many of the emails contained or asked for sensitive data. Password reset emails would often ask users for their date of birth or the last four digits of their Social Security number for their profile. It's not clear why this data was needed, or if it was stored in another database.Other emails informed law enforcement staff of successful enrollment in classes, which contained names, email addresses, phone numbers, the course they were taking, and where and when the course was offered.That data alone would give anyone insight into the capabilities of police and law enforcement departments across the country.""** Disclaimer ** The number of breached records reported reflects our best estimate, based on all the data currently available.If you are a business representative and believe this number is inaccurate, please contact us at chronology@privacyrights.org and we will review and update this record. ","Media","https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-massive-cache-of-law-enforcement-personnel-data-has-leaked/","2018","0.000000","0.000000"

The server appears to belong to an email marketing firm based in California.The data, contained in a 43.5GB dataset, included full names, email addresses, gender information, and physical addresses such as state, city, and ZIP code for 10,999,535 users.All email addresses contained in this database were Yahoo-based, suggesting this was only a small part of a larger dataset, most likely stored on multiple servers.. . .While initially it was not clear who was the owner of this database, one small suffix in several records --such as ""Content-SaverSpy-09092018""-- suggested this data may belong to a company named SaverSpy.Combining a simple Google search along with the nature of the user records found in the exposed database led both this reporter and Diachenko to believe the data belonged to SaverSpy.com, a daily deals website. The SaverSpy.com website claims to operate under the Coupons.com brand, but a Quotient spokesperson told ZDNet today that SaverSpy is only part of an affiliate program.""","Media","https://www.zdnet.com/article/mongodb-server-leaks-11-million-user-records-from-e-marketing-service/","2018","0.000000","0.000000"

(See the full list on our developer site.) It does not include any other data you may have posted or connected to Google+ or any other service, like Google+ posts, messages, Google account data, phone numbers or G Suite content.We discovered and immediately patched this bug in March 2018. We believe it occurred after launch as a result of the API’s interaction with a subsequent Google+ code change.We made Google+ with privacy in mind and therefore keep this API’s log data for only two weeks. That means we cannot confirm which users were impacted by this bug. However, we ran a detailed analysis over the two weeks prior to patching the bug, and from that analysis, the Profiles of up to 500,000 Google+ accounts were potentially affected. Our analysis showed that up to 438 applications may have used this API.We found no evidence that any developer was aware of this bug, or abusing the API, and we found no evidence that any Profile data was misused.","Media","https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/","2018","0.000000","0.000000"
